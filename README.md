Using SQLite, SQLAlchemy to explore and analyze climate date and to share our result with Flask.

## Back Ground:
While on vacation last year in Hawaii I discovered a newfound passion for surfing. I come up with a plan that will not just let me return to Hawaii but live there forever. A Surf N' Shake shop serving surfboards and Icecreams to locals and tourists. I reached out to a investor W. Avy who is famous for his love of surfing. I ran some analytics on a weather dataset that W. Avy provided and presnted the analysis result to W. Avy and his board of directors to support the plan to open the shop on Oahu.

## Overview of the Analysis:
W. Avy likes the analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Result:
  - June:
